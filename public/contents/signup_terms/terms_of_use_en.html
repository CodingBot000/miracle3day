Specific guidance, cautions, and refund policies are provided via operating policies and service guides. The Company may classify Members and differentiate service scope. For operational or technical reasons (e.g., reduced users, technical limits, policy changes), services may change or be discontinued. The Company is a marketplace intermediary, not a party to sales; Partner Clinics may run separate usage and cancellation/refund policies. Members must review such policies; the Company is not liable for damages caused by failure to review. Changes to goods/services will be announced or notified without delay.</p>

<h3>Article 12 (Use of Service)</h3>
<p>In principle, the Service is provided 24/7 absent special business/technical reasons. Regular or ad‑hoc maintenance may be announced at least 24 hours in advance.

<h3>Article 13 (Interruption)</h3>
<p>The Company may restrict or suspend all or part of the Service for reasons such as failure to complete identity verification, interference with business, system needs, telecom outages, force majeure, legal prohibitions, corporate changes, or other significant reasons.

If services cannot continue due to business transition, discontinuation, or integration, the Company will notify Members and compensate under the originally presented conditions; if none were presented, unused Ticket amounts and wallet balances (Mimotok Cash) will be provided in kind or cash of equivalent value.</p>

<h3>Article 14 (Purchase and Reservation)</h3>
<p>Members apply for purchases and reservations via the app after reviewing: product search/selection; personal info; these Terms; cancellation/withdrawal limits and fees; confirmation of application; and payment/reservation time. A pre‑payment/reservation contract is formed upon Partner Clinic acceptance and Company approval. Conditions may vary by clinic and transaction type (e.g., multi‑session passes, period passes, trials, packages). The Company may deny approval for minors purchasing restricted items, technical impediments, false or missing information, restricted Members, or reasons defined in policies. Members are responsible for accuracy of entered information. The Company will notify Members upon accepting an application; Members can view their history in the app. Where personal data must be provided to third parties, consent will be obtained at the time of purchase/reservation with disclosure of items, recipients, purposes, and retention periods, except where otherwise provided by law.</p>

<h3>Article 17 (Points)</h3>
<p>Points may be granted per policy; usable with other methods; details are announced via channels or the app; deducted FIFO; refunded with original validity (for partial cancellation, only the portion allocated to unused Tickets is refunded); not withdrawable in cash; expire upon validity end or termination; may be extinguished per policy (e.g., after a certain period or upon withdrawal); non‑transferable; fraudulently obtained points may be withdrawn; and points used in purchases later canceled may be recovered.</p>

<li>Extinction and refund policies are governed by the Service‑Specific Guide.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Article 19 (Withdrawal of Offer and Refunds)</h3>
<p>Members may withdraw their offer within the period allowed by applicable e‑commerce laws. However, withdrawal may be restricted where the Member is responsible for loss/damage, a Ticket has been used or expired, or per the Company’s cancellation/refund policy (including automatic conversion of unused amounts to Mimotok Cash upon expiry). Multi‑session Tickets are refunded at the single‑session list price for Member‑initiated refunds, or pro‑rata (1/N) if due to clinic fault such as closure.</p>

<h3>Article 20 (Effect of Withdrawal)</h3>
<p>Upon return of goods, the Company/Partner Clinic refunds per policy and requests cancellation of charges to the payment provider where applicable. Return shipping due to withdrawal is borne by the Member (except where goods differ from advertisements or contract). Costs and responsibilities are clearly indicated.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4. Data Protection and IP</h2>

<h3>Article 21 (Advertising and Data Collection)</h3>
<p>The Company may display ads; links to third‑party services are outside the Company’s control and responsibility (except for willful misconduct or gross negligence). The Company may provide personalized ads using posts, searches, interests, language, cookies/device info, IP, browser, OS, and standard logs—see the Privacy Policy. With consent, the Company may send marketing information via SMS/LMS, push, or email; Members may withdraw consent at any time.</p>

<h3>Article 22 (Privacy)</h3>
<p>The Company collects only minimum personal data necessary to provide the Service; does not pre‑collect purchase‑execution data unless required by law; informs purposes and obtains consent for collection/use/provision; does not use or provide for other purposes without additional consent (unless required by law); honors access/correction requests; limits handlers; is liable for loss/theft/leakage without consent; promptly destroys data when purposes are fulfilled; does not pre‑check consent boxes; and does not refuse service for refusal of non‑essential data.</p>

<h3>Article 23 (Rights to Posts)</h3>
<p>Members own and are responsible for their posts and any infringement. At a Partner Clinic’s request, the Company may technically enable exposure of a Member’s post within the clinic’s site or the Service; the Company is not responsible for a clinic’s operation of such exposure. Members grant the Company a free, worldwide, non‑exclusive right to use, edit, transmit, distribute, display, store, broadcast, and prepare derivative works from posts for Service operation, promotion, search, etc., without time or territorial limits, provided the Company does not sell/lease/transfer posts for trade without prior consent. After account deletion, the Member’s personal data is removed, so editing/deleting past posts may be impossible; Members should act before leaving. Posts may be removed or access‑restricted without prior notice if they infringe rights, violate public order, relate to crimes, infringe IP, are illegal/obscene/harmful, contain malware, include unauthorized commercial promotion/links, are irrelevant, contain unverified falsehoods despite verification requests, are requested by authorities, seriously disrupt operations, or otherwise violate these Terms or law. Affected persons may request removal or counter‑notices; the Company acts per policy and law.</p>

<h3>Article 24 (Intellectual Property)</h3>
<p>Copyright and other IP in Service content produced by the Company belong to the Company.

If the Company uses IP owned by a specific Member, it will notify the Member in advance.</p>

<h3>Article 25 (ID and Password)</h3>
<p>Except as provided in Article 9(5), Members are responsible for managing their IDs and passwords, must not allow third‑party use, and must notify and follow Company guidance upon theft or misuse.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5. Limitation of Liability</h2>

<h3>Article 26 (Legal Responsibility of Company and Partner Clinics)</h3>
<p>The Company is legally responsible only for sales of its own goods. For medical acts between Members and Partner Clinics, responsibility lies solely with the parties; the Company, as an intermediary platform, does not intervene.</p>

<h3>Article 27 (No Agency or Warranty)</h3>
<p>The Company does not buy from or sell to Members on behalf of Partner Clinics; it operates, manages, and provides systems to facilitate transactions and does not act as an agent. Responsibility for transaction intent, product quality/completeness/safety/legality/non‑infringement, truthfulness/legality of information, and linked materials rests with Members and Partner Clinics.</p>

<h3>Article 28 (Disclaimers)</h3>
<p>Processing of withdrawals/cancellations and dispute resolution for transactions between Members and Partner Clinics is the responsibility of the contracting parties; the Company is not liable unless otherwise specified herein.

<h3>Article 31 (Dispute Resolution)</h3>
<ol>

<li>When handling complaints or mediating disputes, the Company acts impartially as a third party. Members shall act in good faith and cooperate.</li>
<li>The Company prioritizes and promptly handles complaints and feedback submitted by Members; in disputes between the Company and a Member, both shall consult in good faith.</li>
<li>The Company operates a customer service center for complaints and dispute mediation between Members and Partner Clinics or between Members and third parties.</li>
